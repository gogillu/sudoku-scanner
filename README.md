# Sudoku Scanner

Sudoku Scanner is a machine learning tool designed to solve Sudoku puzzles with ease. By simply capturing an image of a Sudoku puzzle, the tool recognizes the digits, processes the grid, and provides a solution. This project uses computer vision techniques and a trained neural network model to accurately detect and solve Sudoku puzzles from images.

## Features

- **Digit Recognition:** Identifies digits from the Sudoku grid using a pre-trained neural network.
- **Image Processing:** Processes images to detect and extract the Sudoku grid for solving.
- **Real-time Feedback:** Provides solutions instantly upon scanning the puzzle image.
- **Instant Solution:** Flashes the result instantly.
- **Visualize back trekking solution:** Visualization of back trekking solution for sudoku.
